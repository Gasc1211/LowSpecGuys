    <h1>Welcome to LowSpecGuys!</h1>
    <p>
        LowSpecGuys is a community created by a group of friends who loved videogames, computers and coding.
        Our name came from the fact that all in the team don't have great or fancy gamimg computers, so 
        we play low spec or old games that run ok on our hardware with sometimes a little tweaking or modding.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a nutshell, LowSpecGuys is a place for crappy computers, integrated graphics, low-end games, lan parties and last but not least fun.
